## Solana.Unity-SDK

Solana.Unity SDK is comprehensive set of open-source tools to easily access Solana in your Unity-based games. You can install the SDK with the Unity Package Manager and set up your preferred wallet among the available options. Solana.Unity-SDK uses [Solana.Unity-Core](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-Core) implementation, native .NET Standard 2.0 (Unity compatible) with full RPC API coverage, MPL, native DEXes operations and more. The project started as a fork of [unity-solana-wallet](https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet), but it has been detached due to the several changes we made and the upcoming pipeline of wallet integrations, including [SMS](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-stack-sdk) and Raindrops.

## The SDK supports:

- Full JSON RPC API coverage
- Wallet and accounts: Set up of a non-custodial Solana wallet in Unity (sollet and solana-keygen compatible)
- Phantom and Web3auth support (non-custodial signup/login through social accounts)
- Transaction decoding from base64 and wire format and encoding back into wire format
- Message decoding from base64 and wire format and encoding back into wire format
- Instruction decompilation
- TokenWallet object to send and receive SPL tokens and JIT provisioning of Associated Token Accounts
- Basic UI examples
- NFTs
- Compile games to xNFTs (Backpack)
- Native DEX operations (Orca, Jupiter coming soon...)

## Upcoming:

- Wallet support for SMS and Seed Vault.
- Methods to trigger / register custom events to easily integrate custom logics (e.g.: server checks/updates or caching)
- Raindrops
